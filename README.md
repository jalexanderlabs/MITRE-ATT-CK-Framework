This Write-up is to learn about the MITRE organization and the different areas they research. These areas include the ATT&CK framework, CAR Knowledge Base, ENGAGE, D3FEND and AEP.

First off, what is MITRE exactly? 
MITRE is a non-profit organization that provides guidance and research on advanced technology, this also includes security, whichn is what I will be focusing on. 

Basic Terms to Note:

APT(Advanced Persistent Threat): This is a team/group or even a country that engage in long-term attacks against other organizations and/or countries.

TTP(Tactics, Technics, and procedures): TTP is an acronym that gives a basic outline of what a milicious actor, or adversary will perform in order to reach their goal.
Tactic: This is the adversaries goal or obvjective.
Technique: This is how the adversary achieves the objective.
Procedure: This is how the technique is executed. 

ATT&CK Framework

What is the ATT&CK Framework exactly?

This framework is essentially a giant database of adversary tactics and techniques. This heavily includes the before-mentioned APTs and their TTPs that they implement. This tool is useful for individuals who work in a red team environment, but I believe it is quintensential to security teams who defend their organization's network. 

Within the MITRE ATT&CK official website, there is the ATT&CK Matrix, there are 14 categories of techniques an adversary can use to perform their tactics. A lot of these technique sections also include sub techniques. For example, one of the most popular attacks, phishing, has a sub set of techniques like spearfishing, which aims at more important individuals through emails in hopes that the individual will think that the link is legit and click on it. The links can also be used to redirect the target to a site that persuades them to give sensitive information such as passwords to accounts.
